        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>My name is Barkat, I am 21 years old and I am from India. Currenty, I am pursuing a Web development and
            design course at Humber to build my portfolio and gain more experience to achieve my dream of being a
            developer. I am also an undergraduate student in my third year at Uoft (University of Toronto) majoring
            in Computer Science and minoring in Mathematics and Statistics.
            My favourite hobbies are gyming and writing poetry and the color that I resonate with most is brown
            because it signifies comfort and also reminds me of my mother. I hope you enjoy my blog page and my
            different artforms.
        </p>
